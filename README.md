# Search_engine
I have tried to design a search engine in these files.
t1: There is Find_match function that takes a text as input and then calculates match percentage of each category (categories that we have prepared before for function) with inputed text. It returns categories with descending match percentage.

t2 : This script takes a language name and a text as input then translates inputed text to English. After that it sends the translated text to the Find_match function. Finally the result of the Find_match function will be translated to inputed language. This Pyhton file uses googletrans module version 4
